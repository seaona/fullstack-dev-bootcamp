5 PRIMITIVE DATATYPES

- numbers: it doesn't distinguish if it's fractional or negative
4
9.3
-10


- strings: are always inside quotes (they can be single or double quotes)
"hello world"
"42"

*if we want to write double quotes inside the string we can use the ESCAPE CHARACTER \:

	"she said \"goodbye"\to me"

	"To see a backslash: \\"

Properties:
"hello".length  -->counts the characters, including spaces
"hello"[0]    	--> returns "h"
"hello"[4]		-->returns "o"



- booleans: no quotes
true
false


- null: it's explicitly empty/nothing
null


- undefined: if a variable is not initiated with a value it returns
undefined
