JQUERY
It's a DOM manipulation library.
	- select elements
	- manipulate elements
	- create elements
	- add event listeners
	- animate elements
	- add effects
	- make http requests (AJAX)


WHY USE JQUERY
- fixes "broken" DOM API
- brevity and clarity
- ease of use
- cross-browser support
- ajax


WHY NOT USE JQUERY
youmightnotneedjquery.com
- the DOM API is no longer broken
- it doesn't do anything you can do on your own
- it's an unnecessary dependency
- performance

VANILLA JS: It's just writting Javascript WITHOUT jQuery
